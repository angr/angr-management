#Docker packaging for angr management

These files allow running angr management in a docker container.
For most users this should never be necessary as angr management runs natively on the three major OSes (Linux, Windows, macOS).
If for some reason it cannot be run natively, an Ubuntu virtual machine is probably a better option.
The angr team does not actively maintain these files, but will accept pull requests improving them or fixing compatibility.
