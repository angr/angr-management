### 'module' object has noattribute 'MIPS_GRP_CALL'

Your capstone install does not support functionality that angr-management uses.

To install a version that does (in your angr virtualenv):
```
workon angr
git clone https://github.com/angr/capstone
cd capstone
git checkout next
./make.sh
PACKAGES_PATH=$(python -c "from distutils.sysconfig import get_python_lib; print(get_python_lib())")
mkdir -p $PACKAGES_PATH/capstone
cp libcapstone.so.4 $PACKAGES_PATH/capstone/libcapstone.so
cd bindings/python
pip uninstall capstone  # if already installed
python setup.py install
```
