## Plugins

Plugins may be installed by placing a subdirectory under `plugins`. The directory must contain an `__init__.py` like that in `TestPlugin`:
```
from .test_plugin import TestPlugin
PLUGIN_CLS_NAME = TestPlugin.__name__
```

This also allows you to import a plugin class from another package entirely. The plugin itself should inherit from `BasePlugin`. Callbacks and events are a work in progress, so the API is subject to change. See `TestPlugin` for an example of a multithreaded plugin sample.
