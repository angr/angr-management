Absent any constraints on a multi-core system, when multiple threads simultaneously read and write to several variables, one thread can observe the values change in an order different from the order another thread wrote them. Indeed, the apparent order of changes can even differ among multiple reader threads. Some similar effects can occur even on uniprocessor systems due to compiler transformations allowed by the memory model.;The default behavior of all atomic operations in the language and the library provides for sequentially consistent ordering (see discussion below). That default can hurt performance, but the library's atomic operations can be given an additional memory_order argument to specify the exact constraints, beyond atomicity, that the compiler and processor must enforce for that operation.;Constants,  Defined in header <stdatomic.h> \n  Value   Explanation \n  memory_order_relaxed   Relaxed operation: there are no synchronization or ordering constraints imposed on other reads or writes, only this operation's atomicity is guaranteed (see Relaxed ordering below) \n  memory_order_consume   A load operation with this memory order performs a consume operation on the affected memory location: no reads or writes in the current thread dependent on the value currently loaded can be reordered before this load. Writes to data-dependent variables in other threads that release the same atomic variable are visible in the current thread. On most platforms, this affects compiler optimizations only (see Release-Consume ordering below) \n  memory_order_acquire   A load operation with this memory order performs the acquire operation on the affected memory location: no reads or writes in the current thread can be reordered before this load. All writes in other threads that release the same atomic variable are visible in the current thread (see Release-Acquire ordering below) \n  memory_order_release   A store operation with this memory order performs the release operation: no reads or writes in the current thread can be reordered after this store. All writes in the current thread are visible in other threads that acquire the same atomic variable (see Release-Acquire ordering below) and writes that carry a dependency into the atomic variable become visible in other threads that consume the same atomic (see Release-Consume ordering below). \n  memory_order_acq_rel   A read-modify-write operation with this memory order is both an acquire operation and a release operation. No memory reads or writes in the current thread can be reordered before or after this store. All writes in other threads that release the same atomic variable are visible before the modification and the modification is visible in other threads that acquire the same atomic variable. \n  memory_order_seq_cst   A load operation with this memory order performs an acquire operation, a store performs a release operation, and read-modify-write performs both an acquire operation and a release operation, plus a single total order exists in which all threads observe all modifications in the same order (see Sequentially-consistent ordering below) \nAtomic operations tagged memory_order_relaxed are not synchronization operations; they do not impose an order among concurrent memory accesses. They only guarantee atomicity and modification order consistency.;For example, with x and y initially zero,;// Thread 1: r1 = atomic_load_explicit(y, memory_order_relaxed); // A atomic_store_explicit(x, r1, memory_order_relaxed); // B // Thread 2: r2 = atomic_load_explicit(x, memory_order_relaxed); // C atomic_store_explicit(y, 42, memory_order_relaxed); // D.;is allowed to produce r1 == r2 == 42 because, although A is sequenced-before B within thread 1 and C is sequenced before D within thread 2, nothing prevents D from appearing before A in the modification order of y, and B from appearing before C in the modification order of x. The side-effect of D on y could be visible to the load A in thread 1 while the side effect of B on x could be visible to the load C in thread 2. In particular, this may occur if D is completed before C in thread 2, either due to compiler reordering or at runtime.;Typical use for relaxed memory ordering is incrementing counters, such as the reference counters , since this only requires atomicity, but not ordering or synchronization (note that decrementing the shared_ptr counters requires acquire-release synchronization with the destructor).;If an atomic store in thread A is tagged memory_order_release and an atomic load in thread B from the same variable is tagged memory_order_consume, all memory writes (non-atomic and relaxed atomic) that are dependency-ordered-before the atomic store from the point of view of thread A, become visible side-effects within those operations in thread B into which the load operation carries dependency, that is, once the atomic load is completed, those operators and functions in thread B that use the value obtained from the load are guaranteed to see what thread A wrote to memory.;The synchronization is established only between the threads releasing and consuming the same atomic variable. Other threads can see different order of memory accesses than either or both of the synchronized threads.;On all mainstream CPUs other than DEC Alpha, dependency ordering is automatic, no additional CPU instructions are issued for this synchronization mode, only certain compiler optimizations are affected (e.g. the compiler is prohibited from performing speculative loads on the objects that are involved in the dependency chain).;Typical use cases for this ordering involve read access to rarely written concurrent data structures (routing tables, configuration, security policies, firewall rules, etc) and publisher-subscriber situations with pointer-mediated publication, that is, when the producer publishes a pointer through which the consumer can access information: there is no need to make everything else the producer wrote to memory visible to the consumer (which may be an expensive operation on weakly-ordered architectures). An example of such scenario is rcu_dereference.;Note that currently (2/2015) no known production compilers track dependency chains: consume operations are lifted to acquire operations.;If some atomic is store-released and several other threads perform read-modify-write operations on that atomic, a \"release sequence\" is formed: all threads that perform the read-modify-writes to the same atomic synchronize with the first thread and each other even if they have no memory_order_release semantics. This makes single producer - multiple consumers situations possible without imposing unnecessary synchronization between individual consumer threads.;If an atomic store in thread A is tagged memory_order_release and an atomic load in thread B from the same variable is tagged memory_order_acquire, all memory writes (non-atomic and relaxed atomic) that happened-before the atomic store from the point of view of thread A, become visible side-effects in thread B. That is, once the atomic load is completed, thread B is guaranteed to see everything thread A wrote to memory.;The synchronization is established only between the threads releasing and acquiring the same atomic variable. Other threads can see different order of memory accesses than either or both of the synchronized threads.;On strongly-ordered systems \u2014 x86, SPARC TSO, IBM mainframe, etc. \u2014 release-acquire ordering is automatic for the majority of operations. No additional CPU instructions are issued for this synchronization mode; only certain compiler optimizations are affected (e.g., the compiler is prohibited from moving non-atomic stores past the atomic store-release or performing non-atomic loads earlier than the atomic load-acquire). On weakly-ordered systems (ARM, Itanium, PowerPC), special CPU load or memory fence instructions are used.;Mutual exclusion locks, such as mutexes or atomic spinlocks, are an example of release-acquire synchronization: when the lock is released by thread A and acquired by thread B, everything that took place in the critical section (before the release) in the context of thread A has to be visible to thread B (after the acquire) which is executing the same critical section.;Atomic operations tagged memory_order_seq_cst not only order memory the same way as release/acquire ordering (everything that happened-before a store in one thread becomes a visible side effect in the thread that did a load), but also establish a single total modification order of all atomic operations that are so tagged.;Formally,;Each memory_order_seq_cst operation B that loads from atomic variable M, observes one of the following:;If there was a memory_order_seq_cst atomic_thread_fence operation X sequenced-before B, then B observes one of the following:;For a pair of atomic operations on M called A and B, where A writes and B reads M's value, if there are two memory_order_seq_cst atomic_thread_fences X and Y, and if A is sequenced-before X, Y is sequenced-before B, and X appears before Y in the Single Total Order, then B observes either:;For a pair of atomic modifications of M called A and B, B occurs after A in M's modification order if.;Note that this means that:;Sequential ordering may be necessary for multiple producer-multiple consumer situations where all consumers must observe the actions of all producers occurring in the same order.;Total sequential ordering requires a full memory fence CPU instruction on all multi-core systems. This may become a performance bottleneck since it forces the affected memory accesses to propagate to every core.;Relationship with volatile,Within a thread of execution, accesses (reads and writes) through volatile lvalues cannot be reordered past observable side-effects (including other volatile accesses) that are separated by a sequence point within the same thread, but this order is not guaranteed to be observed by another thread, since volatile access does not establish inter-thread synchronization.;In addition, volatile accesses are not atomic (concurrent read and write is a data race) and do not order memory (non-volatile memory accesses may be freely reordered around the volatile access).;One notable exception is Visual Studio, where, with default settings, every volatile write has release semantics and every volatile read has acquire semantics (MSDN), and thus volatiles may be used for inter-thread synchronization. Standard volatile semantics are not applicable to multithreaded programming, although they are sufficient for e.g. communication with a signal handler that runs in the same thread when applied to sig_atomic_t variables.;Examples,", "url": "https://devdocs.io/c/atomic/memory_order\n"}

If the identifier is already defined as any type of macro, the program is ill-formed unless the definitions are identical.;Object-like macros replace every occurrence of a defined identifier with replacement-list. Version (1) of the #define directive behaves exactly like that.;Function-like macros replace each occurrence of a defined identifier with replacement-list, additionally taking a number of arguments, which then replace corresponding occurrences of any of the parameters in the replacement-list.;The syntax of a function-like macro invocation is similar to the syntax of a function call: each instance of the macro name followed by a ( as the next preprocessing token introduces the sequence of tokens that is replaced by the replacement-list. The sequence is terminated by the matching ) token, skipping intervening matched pairs of left and right parentheses.;The number of arguments must be the same as the number of arguments in the macro definition (parameters) or the program is ill-formed. If the identifier is not in functional-notation, i.e. does not have parentheses after itself, it is not replaced at all.;Version (2) of the #define directive defines a simple function-like macro.;Version (3) of the #define directive defines a function-like macro with variable number of arguments. The additional arguments can be accessed using __VA_ARGS__ identifier, which is then replaced with arguments, supplied with the identifier to be replaced.;Version (4) of the #define directive defines a function-like macro with variable number of arguments, but no regular arguments. The arguments can be accessed only with __VA_ARGS__ identifier, which is then replaced with arguments, supplied with identifier to be replaced.;Note: if an argument of a function-like macro includes commas that are not protected by matched pairs of left and right parentheses (such as macro(array[x = y, x + 1]) or atomic_store (p, (struct S){ a, b });), the comma is interpreted as macro argument separator, causing a compilation failure due to argument count mismatch.;In function-like macros, a # operator before an identifier in the replacement-list runs the identifier through parameter replacement and encloses the result in quotes, effectively creating a string literal. In addition, the preprocessor adds backslashes to escape the quotes surrounding embedded string literals, if any, and doubles the backslashes within the string as necessary. All leading and trailing whitespace is removed, and any sequence of whitespace in the middle of the text (but not inside embedded string literals) is collapsed to a single space. This operation is called \"stringification\". If the result of stringification is not a valid string literal, the behavior is undefined.;\n When # appears before __VA_ARGS__, the entire expanded __VA_ARGS__ is enclosed in quotes:\n#define showlist(...) puts(#__VA_ARGS__)\nshowlist();            // expands to puts(\"\")\nshowlist(1, \"x\", int); // expands to puts(\"1, \\\"x\\\", int\")  (since C99)\nA ## operator between any two successive identifiers in the replacement-list runs parameter replacement on the two identifiers and then concatenates the result. This operation is called \"concatenation\" or \"token pasting\". Only tokens that form a valid token together may be pasted: identifiers that form a longer identifier, digits that form a number, or operators + and = that form a +=. A comment cannot be created by pasting / and * because comments are removed from text before macro substitution is considered. If the result of concatenation is not a valid token, the behavior is undefined.;Note: Some compilers offer an extension that allows ## to appear after a comma and before __VA_ARGS__, in which case the ## does nothing when __VA_ARGS__ is non-empty, but removes the comma when __VA_ARGS__ is empty: this makes it possible to define macros such as fprintf (stderr, format, ##__VA_ARGS__).;The order of evaluation of # and ## operators is unspecified.;The #undef directive undefines the identifier, that is it cancels the previous definition of the identifier by #define directive.

The first element of the array holds the real part, and the second element of the array holds the imaginary component.\nfloat a[4] = {1, 2, 3, 4};\nfloat complex z1, z2;\nmemcpy(&z1, a, sizeof z1); // z1 becomes 1.0 + 2.0i\nmemcpy(&z2, a+2, sizeof z2); // z2 becomes 3.0 + 4.0i Complex numbers may be used with arithmetic operators + - * and /, possibly mixed with imaginary and real numbers.

Also, i \u00d7 (\u221e \u2013 i\u221e) = \u221e + i\u221e indicates the reasonable quadrant.\n Imaginary floating types Imaginary floating types model the mathematical imaginary numbers, that is numbers that can be written as a real number multiplied by the imaginary unit: bi The three imaginary types are.\n\n float _Imaginary (also available as float imaginary if <complex.h> is included) \n double _Imaginary (also available as double imaginary if <complex.h> is included) \n long double _Imaginary (also available as long double imaginary if <complex.h> is included) \n Note: as with all type specifiers, any order is permitted: long double imaginary, imaginary long double, and even double imaginary long name the same type.\n#include <complex.h>\n#include <stdio.h>\nint main(void)\n{\n    double imaginary z = 3*I;\n    z = 1/z;\n    printf(\"1/(3.0i) = %+.1fi\\n\", cimag(z));\n} Output:\n1/(3.0i) = -0.3i  \n A compiler that defines __STDC_IEC_559_COMPLEX__ is recommended, but not required to support imaginary numbers.

There are many mathematical functions defined for imaginary numbers in complex.h. Both built-in operators and library functions may raise floating-point exceptions and set errno as described in math_errhandling.\nIncrement and decrement are not defined for imaginary types  Implicit conversions are defined between imaginary types and other arithmetic types.\nThe imaginary numbers make it possible to express all complex numbers using the natural notation x + I*y (where I is defined as _Imaginary_I). Without imaginary types, certain special complex values cannot be created naturally. For example, if I is defined as _Complex_I, then writing 0.0 + I*INFINITY gives NaN as the real part, and CMPLX(0.0, INFINITY) must be used instead. Same goes for the numbers with the negative zero imaginary component, which are meaningful when working with the library functions with branch cuts, such as csqrt: 1.0 - 0.0*I results in the positive zero imaginary component if I is defined as _Complex_I and the negative zero imaginary part requires the use of CMPLX or conj.\nImaginary types also simplify implementations; multiplication of an imaginary by a complex can be implemented straightforwardly with two multiplications if the imaginary types are supported, instead of four multiplications and two additions.\n (since C99)\n\n If the macro constant __STDC_NO_COMPLEX__(C11) is defined by the implementation, the complex types (as well as the library header <complex.h>) are not provided.

The compilers can (and usually do) ignore presence or absence of the inline specifier for the purpose of optimization.;If the compiler performs function inlining, it replaces a call of that function with its body, avoiding the overhead of a function call (placing data on stack and retrieving the result), which may result in a larger executable as the code for the function has to be repeated multiple times. The result is similar to function-like macros, except that identifiers and macros used in the function refer to the definitions visible at the point of definition, not at the point of call.;Regardless of whether inlining takes place, the following semantics of inline functions are guaranteed:;Any function with internal linkage may be declared static inline with no other restrictions.;A non-static inline function cannot define a non-const function-local static and cannot refer to a file-scope static.;If a non-static function is declared inline, then it must be defined in the same translation unit. The inline definition that does not use extern is not externally visible and does not prevent other translation units from defining the same function. This makes the inline keyword an alternative to static for defining functions inside header files, which may be included in multiple translation units of the same program.;If a function is declared inline in some translation units, it does not need to be declared inline everywhere: at most one translation unit may also provide a regular, non-inline non-static function, or a function declared extern inline. This one translation unit is said to provide the external definition. One external definition must exist in the program if the name of the function with external linkage is used in an expression, see one definition rule.;If the external definition exists in the program, the address of the function is always the address of the external function, but when this address is used to make a function call, it's unspecified whether the inline definition (if present in the translation unit) or the external definition is called.

The contents of the resulting array are known as object representation.;If two objects have the same object representation, they compare equal (except if they are floating-point NaNs). The opposite is not true: two objects that compare equal may have different object representations because not every bit of the object representation needs to participate in the value. Such bits may be used for padding to satisfy alignment requirement, for parity checks, to indicate trap representations, etc.;If an object representation does not represent any value of the object type, it is known as trap representation.

That array object may not be referenced both through the restricted pointer and through either its declared name (if it has one) or another restricted pointer.;File scope restricted pointers are useful in providing access to dynamically allocated global arrays; the restrict semantics make it possible to optimize references through this pointer as effectively as references to a static array through its declared name:;The most popular use case for restrict-qualified pointers is the use as function parameters.;In the following example, the compiler may infer that there is no aliasing of modified objects, and so optimize the loop aggressively. Upon entry to f, the restricted pointer a must provide exclusive access to its associated array. In particular, within f neither b nor c may point into the array associated with a, because neither is assigned a pointer value based on a. For b, this is evident from the const-qualifier in its declaration, but for c, an inspection of the body of f is required:;Note that it is permitted for c to point into the array associated with b. Note also that, for these purposes, the \"array\" associated with a particular pointer means only that portion of an array object which is actually referenced through that pointer.;Note that in the example above, the compiler can infer that a and b do not alias because b's constness guarantees that it cannot become dependent on a in the body of the function. Equivalently, the programmer could write void f(int n, float * a, float const * restrict b), in which case the compiler can reason that objects referenced through b cannot be modified, and so no modified object can be referenced using both b and a. If the programmer were to write void f(int n, float * restrict a, float * b), the compiler would be unable to infer non-aliasing of a and b without examining the body of the function.;In general, it is best to explicitly annotate all non-aliasing pointers in a function's prototype with restrict.;A block scope restrict-qualified pointer makes an aliasing assertion that is limited to its block. It allows local assertions that apply only to important blocks, such as tight loops. It also makes it possible to convert a function that takes restrict-qualified pointers into a macro:;The scope of the aliasing assertion made by a restrict-qualified pointer that is a member of a struct is the scope of the identifier used to access the struct.;Even if the struct is declared at file scope, when the identifier used to access the struct has block scope, the aliasing assertions in the struct also have block scope; the aliasing assertions are only in effect within a block execution or a function call, depending on how the object of this struct type was created:;Keywords,restrict.;Example,", "url": "https://devdocs.io/c/language/restrict\n"}

Within any nested bracketed initializer list, the outermost designator refers to the current object and selects the subobject to be initialized within the current object only.\nstruct example ex2 = { // current object is ex2, designators are for members of example\n                       .in_u.a8[0]=127, 0, 0, 1, .addr=80}; \nstruct example ex3 = {80, .in_u={ // changes current object to the union ex.in_u\n                           127,\n                           .a8[2]=1 // this designator refers to the member of in_u\n                      } }; If any subobject is explicitly initialized twice (which may happen when designators are used), the initializer that appears later in the list is the one used (the earlier initializer may not be evaluated):\nstruct {int n;} s = {printf(\"a\\n\"), // this may be printed or skipped\n                     .n=printf(\"b\\n\")}; // always printed Although any non-initialized subobjects are initialized implicitly, implicit initialization of a subobject never overrides explicit initialization of the same subobject if it appeared earlier in the initializer list:\n#include <stdio.h>\ntypedef struct { int k; int l; int a[2]; } T;\ntypedef struct { int i;  T t; } S;\nT x = {.l = 43, .k = 42, .a[1] = 19, .a[0] = 18 };\n // x initialized to {42, 43, {18, 19} }\nint main(void)\n{\n    S l = { 1,          // initializes l.i to 1\n           .t = x,      // initializes l.t to {42, 43, {18, 19} }\n           .t.l = 41,   // changes l.t to {42, 41, {18, 19} }\n           .t.a[1] = 17 // changes l.t to {42, 41, {18, 17} }\n          };\n    printf(\"l.t.k is %d\\n\", l.t.k); // .t = x sets l.t.k to 42 explicitly\n                                    // .t.l = 42 would zero out l.t.k implicitly\n} Output:\nl.t.k is 42 However, when an initializer begins with a left open brace, its current object is fully re-initialized and any prior explicit initializers for any of its subobjects are ignored:\nstruct fred { char s[4]; int n; };\nstruct fred x[ ] = { { { \"abc\" }, 1 }, // inits x[0] to { {'a','b','c','\\0'}, 1 }\n                      [0].s[0] = 'q'   // changes x[0] to { {'q','b','c','\\0'}, 1 }\n                   };\nstruct fred y[ ] = { { { \"abc\" }, 1 }, // inits y[0] to { {'a','b','c','\\0'}, 1 }\n                     [0] = { // current object is now the entire y[0] object\n                             .s[0] = 'q' \n                            } // replaces y[0] with { {'q','\\0','\\0','\\0'}, 0 }\n                    };  (since C99)\nNotes,The initializer list may have a trailing comma, which is ignored.;In C, the braced list of initializers cannot be empty (note that C++ allows empty lists, and also note that a struct in C cannot be empty):;\n Every expression in the initializer list must be a constant expression when initializing aggregates of any storage duration.\n (until C99)\n\n As with all other initialization, every expression in the initializer list must be a constant expression when initializing aggregates of static or thread-local (since C11) storage duration:\nstatic struct {char* p} s = {malloc(1)}; // error The order of evaluation of the subexpressions in any initializer is indeterminately sequenced:\nint n = 1;\nstruct {int x,y;} p = {n++, n++}; // unspecified, but well-defined behavior:\n                                  // n is incremented twice in arbitrary order\n                                  // p equal {1,2} and {2,1} are both valid  (since C99)\nExample,", "url": "https://devdocs.io/c/language/struct_initialization\n"}
, {"name": "Struct declaration", "type": "STANDARD LIB", "description": "A struct is a type consisting of a sequence of members whose storage is allocated in an ordered sequence (as opposed to union, which is a type consisting of a sequence of members whose storage overlaps).;The type specifier for a struct is identical to the  union type specifier except for the keyword used:;Syntax,  struct name(optional) {  struct-declaration-list }    (1)   \n  struct name   (2)   \n  name   -   the name of the struct that's being defined \n  struct-declaration-list   -   any number of variable declarations, bit field declarations, and static assert declarations. Members of incomplete type and members of function type are not allowed (except for the flexible array member described below) \nExplanation,Within a struct object, addresses of its elements (and the addresses of the bit field allocation units) increase in order in which the members were defined. A pointer to a struct can be cast to a pointer to its first member (or, if the member is a bit field, to its allocation unit). Likewise, a pointer to the first member of a struct can be cast to a pointer to the enclosing struct. There may be unnamed padding between any two members of a struct or after the last member, but not before the first member. The size of a struct is at least as large as the sum of the sizes of its members.;\n If a struct defines at least one named member, it is allowed to additionally declare its last member with incomplete array type. When an element of the flexible array member is accessed (in an expression that uses operator . or -> with the flexible array member's name as the right-hand-side operand), then the struct behaves as if the array member had the longest size fitting in the memory allocated for this object. If no additional storage was allocated, it behaves as if an array with 1 element, except that the behavior is undefined if that element is accessed or a pointer one past that element is produced. Initialization, sizeof, and the assignment operator ignore the flexible array member. Structures with flexible array members (or unions who have a recursive-possibly structure member with flexible array member) cannot appear as array elements or as members of other structures.\nstruct s { int n; double d[]; }; // s.d is a flexible array member \n \n    struct s t1 = { 0 };         // OK, d is as if double d[1], but UB to access\n    struct s t2 = { 1, { 4.2 } }; // error: initialization ignores flexible array\n \n    // if sizeof (double) == 8\n    struct s *s1 = malloc(sizeof (struct s) + 64); // as if d was double d[8]\n    struct s *s2 = malloc(sizeof (struct s) + 40); // as if d was double d[5]\n \n    s1 = malloc(sizeof (struct s) + 10); // now as if d was double d[1]. Two bytes excess.\n    double *dp = &(s1->d[0]);    // OK\n    *dp = 42;                    // OK\n    s1->d[1]++;                  // Undefined behavior. 2 excess bytes can't be accessed \n                                 // as double.\n \n    s2 = malloc(sizeof (struct s) + 6);  // same, but UB to access because 2 bytes are\n                                         // missing to complete 1 double\n    dp = &(s2->d[0]);            //  OK, can take address just fine\n    *dp = 42;                    //  undefined behavior\n \n    *s1 = *s2; // only copies s.n, not any element of s.d\n               // except those caught in sizeof (struct s)  (since C99)\n\n Similar to union, an unnamed member of a struct whose type is a struct without name is known as anonymous struct. Every member of an anonymous struct is considered to be a member of the enclosing struct or union. This applies recursively if the enclosing struct or union is also anonymous.\nstruct v {\n   union { // anonymous union\n      struct { int i, j; }; // anonymous structure\n      struct { long k, l; } w;\n   };\n   int m;\n} v1;\n \nv1.i = 2;   // valid\nv1.k = 3;   // invalid: inner structure is not anonymous\nv1.w.k = 5; // valid Similar to union, the behavior of the program is undefined if struct is defined without any named members (including those obtained via anonymous nested structs or unions).\n (since C11)\nForward declaration,A declaration of the following form.;  struct name ;     \nhides any previously declared meaning for the name name in the tag name space and declares name as a new struct name in current scope, which will be defined later.

To access a non-volatile object using volatile semantics, its address must be cast to a pointer-to-volatile and then the access must be made through that pointer.;Any attempt to read or write to an object whose type is volatile-qualified through a non-volatile lvalue results in undefined behavior:;A member of a volatile-qualified structure or union type acquires the qualification of the type it belongs to (both when accessed using the . operator or the -> operator):;If an array type is declared with the volatile type qualifier (through the use of typedef), the array type is not volatile-qualified, but its element type is. If a function type is declared with the volatile type qualified (through the use of typedef), the behavior is undefined.;\n In a function declaration, the keyword volatile may appear inside the square brackets that are used to declare an array type of a function parameter. It qualifies the pointer type to which the array type is transformed.\nThe following two declarations declare the same function:\nvoid f(double x[volatile], const double y[volatile]);\nvoid f(double * volatile x, const double * volatile y);  (since C99)\nA pointer to a non-volatile type can be implicitly converted to a pointer to the volatile-qualified version of the same or compatible type. The reverse conversion can be performed with a cast expression.;Note that pointer to pointer to T is not convertible to pointer to pointer to volatile T; for two types to be compatible, their qualifications must be identical:;Uses of volatile,Note that volatile variables are not suitable for communication between threads; they do not offer atomicity, synchronization, or memory ordering. A read from a volatile variable that is modified by another thread without synchronization or concurrent modification from two unsynchronized threads is undefined behavior due to a data race.;Keywords,volatile.;Example,", "url": "https://devdocs.io/c/language/volatile\n"}

The test takes place before each iteration.;Syntax,  while ( expression ) statement     \n  expression   -   any expression of scalar type. This expression is evaluated before each iteration, and if it compares equal to zero, the loop is exited. \n  statement   -   any statement, typically a compound statement, which serves as the body of the loop \nExplanation,A while statement causes the statement (also called the loop body) to be executed repeatedly until the expression (also called controlling expression) compares equal to zero. The repetition occurs regardless of whether the loop body is entered normally or by a goto into the middle of statement.;The evaluation of expression takes place before each execution of statement (unless entered by a goto). If the controlling expression needs to be evaluated after the loop body, the do-while loop may be used.;If the execution of the loop needs to be terminated at some point,  break statement can be used as a terminating statement.;If the execution of the loop needs to be continued at the end of the loop body,  continue statement can be used as a shortcut.;A program with an endless loop has undefined behavior if the loop has no observable behavior (I/O, volatile accesses, atomic or synchronization operation) in any part of its statement or expression. This allows the compilers to optimize out all unobservable loops without proving that they terminate. The only exceptions are the loops where expression is a constant expression; while(true) is always an endless loop.;\n As with all other selection and iteration statements, the while statement establishes block scope: any identifier introduced in the expression goes out of scope after the statement.\n (since C99)\nNotes,Boolean and pointer expressions are often used as loop controlling expressions.

, {"name": "File input/output", "type": "STANDARD LIB", "description": "The <stdio.h> header provides generic file operation support and supplies functions with narrow character input/output capabilities.;The <wchar.h> header supplies functions with wide character input/output capabilities.;I/O streams are objects of type FILE that can only be accessed and manipulated through pointers of type FILE* (Note: while it may be possible to create a local object of type FILE by dereferencing and copying a valid FILE*, using the address of such copy in the I/O functions is undefined behavior). Each stream is associated with an external physical device (file, standard input stream, printer, serial port, etc).;I/O streams can be used for both unformatted and formatted input and output. They are locale-sensitive and may perform wide/multibyte conversions as necessary. All streams access the same locale object: the one most recently installed with setlocale.;Besides the system-specific information necessary to access the device (e.g. a POSIX file descriptor), each stream object holds the following:;A newly opened stream has no orientation. The first call to fwide or to any I/O function establishes the orientation: a wide I/O function makes the stream wide-oriented, a narrow I/O function makes the stream narrow-oriented. Once set, the orientation can only be changed with freopen. Narrow I/O functions cannot be called on a wide-oriented stream; wide I/O functions cannot be called on a narrow-oriented stream. Wide I/O functions convert between wide and multibyte characters as if by calling mbrtowc and wcrtomb. Unlike the multibyte character strings that are valid in a program, multibyte character sequences in the file may contain embedded nulls and do not have to begin or end in the initial shift state.;POSIX requires that the LC_CTYPE facet of the currently installed C locale is stored within the stream object the moment its orientation becomes wide, and is used for all future I/O on this stream until the orientation is changed, regardless of any subsequent calls to setlocale.;A text stream is an ordered sequence of characters composed into lines (zero or more characters plus a terminating '\\n'). Whether the last line requires a terminating '\\n' is implementation-defined. Characters may have to be added, altered, or deleted on input and output to conform to the conventions for representing text in the OS (in particular, C streams on Windows OS convert \\n to \\r\\n on output, and convert \\r\\n to \\n on input).;Data read in from a text stream is guaranteed to compare equal to the data that were earlier written out to that stream only if all of the following is true:;A binary stream is an ordered sequence of characters that can transparently record internal data. Data read in from a binary stream always equals to the data that were earlier written out to that stream. Implementations are only allowed to append a number of null characters to the end of the stream. A wide binary stream doesn't need to end in the initial shift state.;POSIX implementations do not distinguish between text and binary streams (there is no special mapping for \\n or any other

If the consumed sequence has length zero or if the consumed sequence cannot be converted as specified above, the matching failure occurs unless end-of-\ufb01le, an encoding error, or a read error prevented input from the stream, in which case it is an input failure.\nAll conversion specifiers other than [, c, and n consume and discard all leading whitespace characters (determined as if by calling isspace) before attempting to parse the input. These consumed characters do not count towards the specified maximum field width.\nThe conversion specifiers lc, ls, and l[ perform multibyte-to-wide character conversion as if by calling mbrtowc() with an mbstate_t object initialized to zero before the first character is converted.\nThe conversion specifiers s and [ always store the null terminator in addition to the matched characters.

If the first character of the set is ^, then all characters not in the set are matched. If the set begins with ] or ^] then the ] character is also included into the set. It is implementation-defined whether the character - in the non-initial position in the scanset may be indicating a range, as in [0-9]. If width specifier is used, matches only up to width. Always stores a null character in addition to the characters matched (so the argument array must have room for at least width+1 characters).\n\n  d   matches a decimal integer.

Unlike %s and %[, does not append the null character to the array.\n  N/A   N/A   char*   wchar_t*   N/A   N/A   N/A   N/A   N/A \n   s    matches a sequence of non-whitespace characters (a string)  If width specifier is used, matches up to width or until the first whitespace character, whichever appears first. Always stores a null character in addition to the characters matched (so the argument array must have room for at least width+1 characters).\n\n   [set]   matches a non-empty sequence of character from set of characters.  If the first character of the set is ^, then all characters not in the set are matched. If the set begins with ] or ^] then the ] character is also included into the set. It is implementation-defined whether the character - in the non-initial position in the scanset may be indicating a range, as in [0-9]. If width specifier is used, matches only up to width. Always stores a null character in addition to the characters matched (so the argument array must have room for at least width+1 characters).\n\n   d   matches a decimal integer.

The \ufb01rst character, if any, after this consumed sequence remains unread. If the consumed sequence has length zero or if the consumed sequence cannot be converted as specified above, the matching failure occurs unless end-of-\ufb01le, an encoding error, or a read error prevented input from the stream, in which case it is an input failure.\nAll conversion specifiers other than [, c, and n consume and discard all leading whitespace characters (determined as if by calling iswspace) before attempting to parse the input. These consumed characters do not count towards the specified maximum field width.\nIf the length specifier l is not used, the conversion specifiers c, s, and [ perform wide-to-multibyte character conversion as if by calling wcrtomb() with an mbstate_t object initialized to zero before the first character is converted.\nThe conversion specifiers s and [ always store the null terminator in addition to the matched characters. The size of the destination array must be at least one greater than the specified field width. The use of %s or %[, without specifying the destination array size, is as unsafe as gets.\nThe correct conversion specifications for the fixed-width integer types (int8_t, etc) are defined in the header <inttypes.h> (although SCNdMAX, SCNuMAX, etc is synonymous with %jd, %ju, etc).\nThere is a sequence point after the action of each conversion specifier; this permits storing multiple fields in the same \"sink\" variable.\nWhen parsing an incomplete floating-point value that ends in the exponent with no digits, such as parsing \"100er\" with the conversion specifier %f, the sequence \"100e\" (the longest prefix of a possibly valid floating-point number) is consumed, resulting in a matching error (the consumed sequence cannot be converted to a floating-point number), with \"r\" remaining. Some existing implementations do not follow this rule and roll back to consume only \"100\", leaving \"er\", e.g. glibc bug 1765.\n\n  Conversion specifier   Explanation   Argument type \n  length modifier   hh (C99).\n  h   (none)   l   ll (C99).\n  j (C99).\n  z (C99).\n  t (C99).\n  L \n  %   matches literal %   N/A   N/A   N/A   N/A   N/A   N/A   N/A   N/A   N/A \n  c    matches a character or a sequence of characters If a width specifier is used, matches exactly width wide characters (the argument must be a pointer to an array with sufficient room).

The \ufb01rst character, if any, after this consumed sequence remains unread. If the consumed sequence has length zero or if the consumed sequence cannot be converted as specified above, the matching failure occurs unless end-of-\ufb01le, an encoding error, or a read error prevented input from the stream, in which case it is an input failure.\nAll conversion specifiers other than [, c, and n consume and discard all leading whitespace characters (determined as if by calling iswspace) before attempting to parse the input.

Always stores a null character in addition to the characters matched (so the argument array must have room for at least width+1 characters).\n\n  [set]   matches a non-empty sequence of character from set of characters.  If the first character of the set is ^, then all characters not in the set are matched. If the set begins with ] or ^] then the ] character is also included into the set. It is implementation-defined whether the character - in the non-initial position in the scanset may be indicating a range, as in [0-9]. If width specifier is used, matches only up to width. Always stores a null character in addition to the characters matched (so the argument array must have room for at least width+1 characters).\n\n  d   matches a decimal integer.

The encoding used to represent characters in a multibyte character string is locale-specific: it may be UTF-8, GB18030, EUC-JP, Shift-JIS, etc. For example, the char array {'\\xe4','\\xbd','\\xa0','\\xe5','\\xa5','\\xbd','\\0'} is an NTMBS holding the string \"\u4f60\u597d\" in UTF-8 multibyte encoding: the first three bytes encode the character \u4f60, the next three bytes encode the character \u597d. The same string encoded in GB18030 is the char array {'\\xc4', '\\xe3', '\\xba', '\\xc3', '\\0'}, where each of the two characters is encoded as a two-byte sequence.;In some multibyte encodings, any given multibyte character sequence may represent different characters depending on the previous byte sequences, known as \"shift sequences\". Such encodings are known as state-dependent: knowledge of the current shift state is required to interpret each character. An NTMBS is only valid if it begins and ends in the initial shift state: if a shift sequence was used, the corresponding unshift sequence has to be present before the terminating null character. Examples of such encodings are BOCU-1 and SCSU.;A multibyte character string is layout-compatible with null-terminated byte string (NTBS), that is, can be stored, copied, and examined using the same facilities, except for calculating the number of characters.
