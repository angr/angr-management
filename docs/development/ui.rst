Manipulating UI elements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``workspace`` contains methods to manipulate UI elements. Notably, you can
manipulate all open tabs with `the workspace.view_manager reference
<https://github.com/angr/angr-management/blob/master/angrmanagement/ui/view_manager.py>`_.
Additionally, you can pass any sort of object you like to ``workspace.viz()``
and it will attempt to visualize the object in the current window.
